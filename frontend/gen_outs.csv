77^annoyed^I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails. Well, sometimes people are busy and don't have the time to check emails It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?^I'm sure you can do it, but it's hard to do if you don't have time to check emails.^Text and emails are still the best option., until a nw way is created.

175^nostalgic^Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood^I can understand that. I used to love to play with toys.^I've heard a lot of people say something similar. Did you go there a lot?
176^nostalgic^Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood I've heard a lot of people say something similar. Did you go there a lot? I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era^That's pretty cool. I'm glad you had a good time.^Where I grew up didn't have one nearby so I get a little jealous hearing about it.

I completely understand. I had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player. Totally remember doing that!

Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?^No, I don't think I've ever. It's hard to get kids to be a part of society.^Well, I was referring to my own kids. They have adjusted well at 17 and 19.
182^surprised^I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.^That's great. What did you expect?^I also saw it and felt like it was pretty good. Much better than the My Little Pony Movie. That was TORTURE.

185^angry^My parents keep taking my money That's not nice of them. Why do they keep taking it?? They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.^I'm sorry you have to deal with that.^Sorry to hear that. I found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts, so whenever you get a certain amount of money (like $5, $10) save it and be strict not to spend it.
186^annoyed^"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!"^I don't think that's the case at all.^"LOL! This is perfect timing because I had the "" You are an adult not a child"" conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago. I had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky. I argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat Popsicles in bed, then you have to deal with the consequences."

(And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)"^I'm sorry to hear that. I am sure you will have a good relationship with her in the future.^Okay, it wasn't just one, it was three: One cherry, and two grape. How anyone can eat just one at a time? Oh, the number of wrappers was also brought up. Like, I don't care if yuo bought them for the kids, I am part of this household as well. I tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don't get the popsicles first someone else would, but I think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now, lol

I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.^I'm sorry you have to deal with that.^Exactly, sometimes I think women like drama.

1090^joyful^I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.^That's awesome! What classes did you take?^Going to college is a good thing, but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner.
1091^joyful^I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done. Going to college is a good thing, but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner. Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!^That's really sucks. I hope you get to graduate sooner.^That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.

1097^afraid^Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window. Oh wow, sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it? By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.^I'm glad you didn't have to get out of the house.^Did you have any damage to your home?

1103^disgusted^This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from. Uh oh! What did it end up coming from?

Clean that up quick so it doesn't grow mold!

1107^angry^If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?! I know the feeling. You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.^I understand. It's just not right.^"Leave a note on their door. and at the end put ""thanks in advance"" lol"

1109^angry^"Leave a note on their door. and at the end put ""thanks in advance"" lol Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol. Well, you can at least try. I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!"^Yeah, I can understand that.^You could get earplugs lol
1110^apprehensive^I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!^I am sure it will be ok^Oh man! What happened to your hip?
1111^apprehensive^I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me! Oh man! What happened to your hip?

I hope you get better soon!^Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?
1112^apprehensive^Oh man! What happened to your hip? I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again! Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney? From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?^I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you can get your life back on track.^If it's medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks, it's only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) You can always try and you won't be charged if you don't win. It's pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me..

Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.^That's a good idea. It's a good idea to have a lawyer that can help you out.^Thank you! I hear you..I didn't want to do it at first...but it's worth it for her..It's a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it, botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!

It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?^I hope so, too! I've never been a dad myself, but I've had a lot of great experiences.^Yeah, I'll consider it. That's a nice thought.

I am sure you will be fine.^That sucks, I hope you get it figured out!

I know, I'm being selfish.^Oh, well, I'm sure you'll get there soon!^I don't think you're being selfish, you're doing your best!

1460^terrified^Once, I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house. It must have being terrifying! Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.^I'm glad it wasn't a burglary.^Tnank god! They should have let you know they where going to do the job.
1461^disappointed^I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.^That's not good. I'm sorry you felt that way.^That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises.
1462^disappointed^I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary. That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises. Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.^I agree. People need to learn to respect their promises.^I don't understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!
1463^anxious^I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.^That's a real shame. I'm sure you did a great job.^oh, that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?

I'm glad you made it through.

I hope you are able to get it back^But at least you lucked out and they brought it back!
1472^sentimental^I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.^I'm sorry to hear that. I used to be a nurse when I was a kid.^Ah, I know what you mean! And remember *yearning* to be older?!

And remember *yearning* to be older?! (And of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads, thinking the way we are now ;-)) Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha^Yeah, that's a good thing! I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me.^As long as you keep your playful spirit, you're in good shape! Sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness, but I can see it in you!

I'm happy for you.^That sounds like a lot of fun, it's so rewarding to have a position where you can engage with other people. You really seem motivating and inspiring, so I'm happy you have that job!
1476^disappointed^I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.^That's terrible. Did you call him back?^What did you do after waiting for 2 hours?

We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship! Silver linings do happen, maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you. Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.^I'm sorry to hear that.^Maybe not a true friend after all.
1479^jealous^I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.^Oh wow, that's a lot of money! What did she win?^I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!
1480^jealous^I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck. I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?! She won $5,000 and never offered to share.^That's a lot of money!^That's a lot of money, to me anyway. Perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off, or perhaps she has kids to take care of?
1481^prepared^I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.^That's great! I hope you did well!^Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?
1482^prepared^I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in. Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart? I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.^That's really great! I hope you did well!^Well done! You should be proud.
1483^hopeful^I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.^I bet you are excited.^If I'm understanding you correctly, they're going to clean it up, right?

How long has it been derelict?
1485^terrified^I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex).

Did you find out who it was?^What did they or the person do to you?

Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me! What did they or the person do to you? Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.^That's a good idea. I'm sorry to hear that.^Broom would be a good choice, hit them in the crotch, that will stop them.

Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did? Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?^I haven't. I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere. It's so far away from me.^No, I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However, I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.
1489^embarrassed^I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.^Oh no, what happened?^Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds. What happened?

He said he was only being nice, but I felt he was being a bit 'too nice', which made me feel a bit upset. That is VERY understandable. Emotional affair is still a betrayal. Well, we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there, and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated, but he was very insistent about it, even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others."^I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you will get through it.^Well it's nice he is kind but yes that is a little strange. Women can usually take that as something and try to get with your man.

Needless to say, I was very, very upset! That is terrible. I don't know why teenage boys can be so mean. What did you end up doing? I actually knew his father, so I called and spoke to him about it. I let him know that if it happened again, I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her, as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her.^That is really good, I hope she doesn't get hurt again.^That's good that she has a big brother that can defend her against the bigger kids. It is just terrible that a teenage boy would act that way to a 10 year old. No excuse for that. I hope you don't have to deal with it again, though.

Just last night, I was watching Live PD and there was a young man stealing a candy bar. He was a drug addict. I believe if he had the help he needed, he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food.

Kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!

3415^sad^My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her.^That's awesome. Is she okay?^That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster.

But I guess that suits some people.

I hope you're able to get back to playing again. I've taken up running and swimming, and it's interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day. It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!^That's a good plan, I'm sure you'll be able to play a lot of golf again.

Even in the day time

I'm glad you're able to get through it.^That's really odd. I wonder why they didn't have the courtesy to let you know that they'd lost interest or whatever the case may be.

Someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people. Though I suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time.

3594^sentimental^I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly. That would bring the tears. I love looking at pictures especially old ones. Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!^I miss my mom too. I am so sorry to hear that.^Sounds like you are conflicted. She ran off but she's the best? Are you being sarcastic?

And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.^Oh no, that's not cool.^Yeah, that's what they tell everyone because, in reality, they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves. I was pretty peeved that I couldn't even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers.

That's horrible news! I don't understand how people can be so cruel sometimes.

I would be so sad if they didn't take care of the animals.^I know in some places, the penalty for hurting an animal can be tougher than that for hurting your kids. Nothing makes sense sometimes.

We have a lot in common- I feel the same way. Keep chatting? Poor rescue animals.

It's a shame that they had to stay in jail.^They should- they say people who hurt animals will hurt people too.
